# Retail Sales Analysis (Python + Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a retail transactional dataset to understand sales performance, profitability, and customer purchasing patterns. The goal was to clean raw business data, perform analysis using Python, and create a business intelligence dashboard to support decision-making.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL-style aggregations using Pandas groupby
- Jupyter Notebook (Kaggle)
- Power BI (Data Visualization)

## Data Preparation
The raw dataset contained missing values and unstructured date information. The following steps were performed:

- Converted Order Date to datetime format
- Extracted Year, Month, and Day features
- Handled missing values
- Standardized column formats
- Created a cleaned dataset for analysis

## Analysis Performed
Key business questions answered:

- Which product category generates the most profit?
- Which region has the highest sales?
- How do sales change over time?
- Which months have peak revenue?

Using Pandas, aggregations similar to SQL GROUP BY queries were performed:
- Sales by Region
- Profit by Category
- Monthly Revenue Trends

## Dashboard (Power BI)
A Power BI dashboard was created showing:

- Revenue trends over time
- Profit by product category
- Sales by region

## Key Insights
- Technology products generated the highest profit
- Sales increased significantly in later years
- Some categories produced high sales but low profit
- Certain regions consistently outperformed others

## Business Recommendations
- Increase inventory for high-profit technology products
- Investigate low-profit categories with high sales
- Focus marketing efforts on top-performing regions
